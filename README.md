# Project Nicholas

The app is a shoe reselling website where buyers and sellers of hyped up shoes can come together and buy/sell brand new shoes. Sellers are able to create accounts and list their shoes onto the marketplace for anyone to buy, and buyers are able to make accounts to buy shoes. Users are able to view their own profile, which consists of all their past purchases of shoes, their past sales of shoes, and what they have currently listed on the webpage.

## Deployment

The app is a full stack MERN application, meaning it was coded using MongoDB, ExpressJS, React.js and Node.js. The programming languages used in this app were Javascript, HTMl and CSS. The framework used in this project is the ExpressJS framework, a Node.js framework used to build the backend of this app. The library used in this project is the React library, used to code the frontend client of the webpage. As for the overall code design, the application followed a Client-Server model, where the React frontend acted as the client that sends requests to the Express server, which then interacted with the MongoDB database. The Express backend acted as a RESTful API to serve data to the frontend. Also, the React frontend took advantage of components to produce reusable structures that led to an efficient webpage. Also, JWT was used in order to ensure secure user authentication and authorization checks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
